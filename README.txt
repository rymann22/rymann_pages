Welcome to rymann pages!

This is my take on "man pages" for bash, but I'll also have similar pages for python, java, and postgres. A lot of this will be updated "as used". By that I mean, I am currently in a java class for school, and have two more after that. As I'm going through and taking notes, I'll make my own "rymann pages" that I can reference in a way that I believe will be more useful.

Files have date created at the top in YYYY/MM/DD format
